# Website Redesign - Review Request

Hi Allie,

I've been working on a refreshed version of the Thymeless Treats website and wanted to get your thoughts before we go live. The goal was to create something that feels more modern and lets your beautiful work speak for itself.

**To view the site**: I'll share a link once it's ready for preview, or I can walk you through it in person if that's easier.

## What's New

### Overall Feel
- Cleaner, more spacious layout with the sage green brand color throughout
- Larger photos that really showcase your work
- Simpler navigation (Order, Menus, Gallery, Contact)
- Mobile-friendly design since most customers are browsing on their phones

### Homepage
- Features the current seasonal menu front and center (Valentine's right now)
- Four category cards: Holiday Collection, Cookies, Custom Cakes, Gifts
- Simple call-to-action to view gallery or place order

### Gallery
- Filter buttons to sort by category (Cookies, Cakes, Holiday, Events)
- Lightbox viewer when you tap an image - can swipe through on phone
- Shows captions for each photo

### Menu Pages
- Each menu (Valentine's, Christmas, etc.) has its own page with your header photo
- Product cards showing each item with photo, description, and price
- "Sold Out" badge option for items that are no longer available

### Order Page

- Clear steps explaining the order process
- Links to browse menus first

## Questions for You

I'd love your honest feedback on any of these:

1. **Does the overall look match what you want for Thymeless Treats?** 
   - It's going for that clean, warm farmhouse aesthetic
   - If it feels too minimal or too busy, I can adjust

2. **Homepage hero area** - Right now it's a soft background with just your bakery name. Alternatives:
   - A large featured photo instead (more visual impact)
   - A rotating slideshow of your best work
   - Your Instagram feed embedded

3. **Navigation** - Currently: Order, Menus, Gallery, Contact. The "Order" button goes directly to the Valentine's menu. Does that make sense, or would you rather it go to the order form?

4. **Menu page layout** - Products are shown in a grid with photos. Let me know if:
   - The descriptions are too long or too short
   - Prices should be displayed differently
   - You'd prefer a simpler list format

5. **About page** - I wrote some placeholder text about you and your approach. Please let me know what feels right and what you'd change. This is your voice, not mine.

6. **Gallery categories** - Currently: Cookies, Cakes & Cupcakes, Holiday Treats, Special Events. Do these groupings make sense? Any you'd add or rename?

7. **Contact page** - Shows Instagram, Facebook, and email with a FAQ section. Anything missing?

8. **Any photos that shouldn't be used?** The gallery pulls from your existing images. If any are outdated or not representative of your current work, I can remove them.

## Things I Can Easily Change

- Colors (though sage green seems on-brand)
- Font choices
- Photo sizes and layouts
- Navigation labels
- Any text content
- Which menu is "featured" on the homepage
- Adding or removing pages

---

## Things That Would Take More Time

- Completely different layout structures
- New features (like an online store with cart checkout)
- Anything requiring new photography

---

Take your time looking through it. There's no rush - I'd rather get it right than get it fast. Let me know when you'd like to discuss, whether that's a quick phone call, text back, or meeting up.

Thanks,
[Your name]

*P.S. - The current live site will stay up until you give the thumbs up on this new version. Nothing changes until you say go.*
